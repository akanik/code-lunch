# Getting Started
We're going to start by installing some important things on your computers. These will be useful in all the coding things you'll do in the future.

## Virtual Environments
In order to download things (languages, libraries, etc) on your computer, you'll want to set up a virtual environment system.

A virtual environment allows you to install different versions of things on your computer so you can avoid permissions and agreement issues. Permissions issues come about when you are logged in as a user that does not have sufficient permissions to download languages, libraries or modules. Agreement issues come about when you install the wrong versions of certain languages, libraries or modules so things that should work seamlessly with each other throw error messages and will not function.

The virtual environment system I use is called Virtual Environment Wrapper, or virtualenvwrapper.
