Several power poles were knocked over and several trees snapped and uprooted. The majority of the damage orginated on the southwest corners of the barns and pushed out to the northeast. The overall damage path extended 3 miles and had a maximum width of 1/2 mile. The duration of the thunderstorm event was approximately 3 minutes. Damage to the UK agricultural facilities was estimated to be in excess of 4 million dollars.,CSV

The storms developed along and just ahead of a cold front as it pressed southward into the Lower Ohio Valley and extreme southeast Missouri.","A tornado quickly developed over the city of Hickman and moved southeast across  Fulton County. This was the second of two tornadoes in Fulton County. In the center of Hickman, the tornado caused significant damage to the county's jail and 911 communications center, which lost parts of the roof and a section of a wall. About 100 inmates were moved to other facilities. Other damage in Hickman included a heavily damaged gas station, numerous downed signs and power poles, and considerable roof damage to a few homes. The tornado damaged or destroyed more than 45 homes and other buildings in the county, as well as several machine sheds, barns, grain bins, and irrigation systems. At least 20 power poles were broken, and numerous trees were uprooted and snapped. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet Fulton County Highway Maintenance Facility was hit by the tornado. The salt dome, a tractor shed, and several tractors housed in the shed were damaged. The tornado reached its peak intensity just southeast of Hickman along Highway 125, where a frame house had its entire roof structure blown off. The tornado followed Highway 125 from the center of Hickman to the junction of Highway 166, about 4.5 miles southeast of Hickman. Most state highways were closed in and near Hickman, and the Red Cross opened a shelter. Peak winds were estimated near 125 mph. Straight-line winds up to 80 mph occurred mainly southwest of the tornado path. The tornado crossed into Tennessee along State Route 116.",CSV

The most significant damage occurred on Jones Ln where 100 mph winds completely destroyed a couple of large barns, along with other small outbuildings.

After destroying another older barn, the tornado ended just east of Highway 55 where numerous softwood trees were snapped and uprooted. Very strong convergence was noted in the damage. Also of note, were several instances of straight line wind damage feeding into the main circulation from the south. These wind speeds were estimated at 70-80 mph.
