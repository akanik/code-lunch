# README

The README is a common file you'll find in data/code projects. Please, always read them. They are full of important information.

## Basic data analysis code structure

Here's how python code written to analyze data is usually structured:

- *Import necessary libraries/modules:* To use any code that isn't included in the base python, we need to import it at the top of our python file
- *Call the data:* In order to analyze the data you need to make python aware of it.
- *Do stuff to the data:* We do stuff to the data with functions. Functions can be things we write ourselves, or things that we call from the libraries/modules we import
- *Export the data:* Sometimes this means we bring in a csv file and export a smaller, more readable csv file. Sometimes this means we bring in a csv file and output a chart that makes the data easier to understand.
